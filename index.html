    <p>Hello Eveyone, I'm from Guatemala and I just recently changed my major 
        from Chemistry to Software engineering so it was a big change to me but 
        I am very excited for this new adventure. Fun fact about me is that I served 
        my mission in Idaho Falls and Rexburg was one of my longest areas I served in. 
        I loved this area a lot so that is why I decided to come to BYUI.</p> 
        <p>I am a huge soccer fan, I have been playing soccer my whole life, but I also 
        enjoy playing any other sport. I am also super competitive when I play 
        video games. </p>
