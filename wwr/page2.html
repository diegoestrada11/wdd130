                The Salmon River area has been home to people for at least the last 8,000 years. Much of 
                the area was inhabited by several tribes, including the Nez Pierce.  The river was a 
                rich source of food for the indigenous people of the area, who relied on the abundant 
                salmon and other wildlife.  Today the Wild & Scenic Main Salmon basin contains most 
                (up to 70 percent) of the remaining, prime salmon and steelhead habitat in the entire 
                Columbia River basin. In 1805, Lewis & Clark ventured down the Salmon River, only to 
                turn back after they deemed it too rough to be navigable. Hence the name…River of No 
                Return.  Since the time of Lewis & Clark, hundreds of people homesteaded along this 
                majestic river creating a very unique and impressive history.  Today the Main Salmon 
                is designated as one of the nations Wild & Scenic Rivers and provides recreational 
                opportunities and likelihoods for countless visitors, homesteaders, guides and wild 
                river characters.
                The River of No Return offers the perfect alternative to Rocky’s famous Middle Fork of 
                the Salmon River trips. Due to its proximity to the Middle Fork, the Main Salmon could 
                be the most under-rated river in the United States. The mighty River of No Return, 
                named by Lewis & Clark, cuts through the deepest canyon in the US through the Frank 
                Church Wilderness. This massive canyon boasts pristine white sand beaches, massive 
                Yellowpine trees, summer-long whitewater, history and the best natural hotsprings in 
                Idaho!
